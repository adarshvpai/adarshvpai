## u_4r7 - [EMBEDDED]

1. Searched which device is used to capture the signal transmitted through UART.

2. Searched which connections are made with Arduino board and Logic Analyzer.

3. Hint was given to make connections from the pins of Rx1,Tx1 from the Arduino Board to Logic analyzers.

4. Necessary connections are made between Arduino Board, Logic Analyzer and system.

5. Downloaded Logic Analyzer Software from Google.

6. The necessary Channels were selected and Analyzer was set to Async Serial Analayzer.

7. The signal was captured in the software and the flag was revealed.

Flag - wired{...}
